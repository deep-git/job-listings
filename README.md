# Job Listings Page
This project is a Frontend Mentor challenge project that utilizes HTML, Tailwind CSS, and React to create a job listings page. The page contains a number of job listings that is retrieved through JSON data and displayed. Each job listing contains the company name, position, and other job specific details. 

Additionally, each job listing contains a list of tags (example: HTML, CSS, Junior, Senior, etc...) that are associated with that specific job post. Users are able to click these tags to add filters to the job listing page. These filters will reduce the number of job postings and only display the postings that contain that specific tag as well. For instance, if a user clicked on a javascript tag, all the job postings that also have the javascript tag will be displayed. This allows users to easily filter through and search for specific job postings based on these tags.
